# Tokamak-Resistive-Wall-Simulation
(Magnetohydrodynamic simulations in complex geometries)


Code project for ideal plasma simulaiton under a resistive tokamak vessel when my MPhil project. This use a ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model along with Mixed Divergence Cleaning method. The MHD solver is MHD-HLLC slover with MUSCL-Hancock second order accuracy extension.

In general, the project yield some interesting results. This repository collect the code and some results. But the data are too big to be put here. 

However, it seem that commonly used copy resistive boundary condition has some problems. So further work on a resistive Robin boundary condition should give a better boundary condition for resisitive wall.
