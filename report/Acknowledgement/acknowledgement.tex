I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Maria Nikodemou. Despite my initial hesitancy and limited understanding, she encouraged me to pursue exploratory research, fostering significant growth in my academic journey. The period of intense engagement in reading and research under her guidance has been invaluable. While this may mark the conclusion of my in-depth engagement in such work, I will remain profoundly grateful to Dr. Maria Nikodemou and will always value the knowledge and experiences acquired during this period.
