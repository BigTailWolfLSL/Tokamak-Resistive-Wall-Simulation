In order to compile this LaTeX document you should run the following:

make MPhil_Poster_Template.pdf

If latexmk is not installed on your machine, use the following instead:

pdflatex MPhil_Poster_Template.tex
bibtex MPhil_Poster_Template
pdflatex MPhil_Poster_Template.tex
pdflatex MPhil_Poster_Template.tex

in order to get all the cross-references correct, including those
from your BiBTeX file references.bib

The above template will produce a poster suitable for printing onto A2 paper.

If you need to produce an A1 poster, you should use
MPhil_Poster_Template_A1.tex instead. This gives a three column version of the above.

Students who are part of the Materials CDT should use the .tex files beginning CDT_ instead.

Caveats:
The behaviour of the beamer-latex package seems to have changed between versions
of TexLive. The current templates give reasonable results in the latest version
of TeXLive, but may give odd font sizes in older versions.

I have tested these LaTeX files with TeXLive 2015, 2017, and 2019 and results look reasonable in all three.
Some tweaking may be required for different versions of TeXLive, or for typesetting
requirements not covered by the example.

There is also a PowerPoint template for A2 which should match the MPhil LaTeX template.
It should be easy to adapt this to a CDT template.
